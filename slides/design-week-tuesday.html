          <h2><span class="bigunderline">DAY 2</span></h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Today, you get to focus on solutions. <br />
            - The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. <br/>
            - Then each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. <br/>
            - By the end of the morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions based on your sketches from the morning. <br/>
            - That’s great, but it’s also a problem. <br />
            - You can’t prototype and test them all — you need one solid plan. <br />
            - In the afternoon, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. <br />
            - Then, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.

          <h1>Find inspiration</h1>
          <p>30 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Think of this as the product / process audit, or inspiration section of the discovery workshop <br/>
            - Independently find example services that do something similar to what you are trying to achieve. Get creative, they don't need to be in the same field or have the same end objectives. <br/>
            - There may be a range of things that you find interesting - design, the user flow, the actual solution to the problem etc. <br/>
            - Each try to find 3-4 examples, focus on quality, not quantity. What is it that you like about the examples you have found? <br/>
            - Talk to each other as you discover so that you don't spend too much time overlapping

        <section>
          <h1>Show and tell</h1>
          <p>30 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Nominate one person from the group (or rotate the responsibility) to sketch <br/>
            - Look at the solutions that your group has found! Each person can take two-three minutes to demo what they like about that website / service / app. Time yourselves! <br/>
            - Capture the good ideas with a quick panel drawing on the whiteboard (or piece of paper) <br/>
            - what is it that really stands out about that product / design / experience? How can you capture that in a one frame sketch

          <h1>Silent note taking</h1>
          <p>15 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Spread out all of the sketches from your product audit <br/>
            - Silently (independently) take notes on all of the example sketches. What stands out to you? What do you think falls short? What could be improved upon?

        <section>
          <h1>Ideate</h1>
          <p>15 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Take 15 minutes to do a private brainstorm. <br/>
            - Give each person time to develop solutions on his or her own.<br/>
            - Using the examples as inspiration, start to jot down your own ideas of how your project might take form <br/>

        <section>
          <h1>Crazy Eights</h1>
          <p>20 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Fold a sheet of paper to create eight frames. <br/>
            - Sketch a variation of one of your best ideas in each frame. Spend approximately 2 minutes per sketch. <br/>
            - They don't have to be pretty! <br/>
            - They don't need to be consecutive <br/>
            - Anyone can sketch. Most solution sketches are just rectangles and words. <br/>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>One solution in three frames</h1>
          <p>25 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Create a three-panel summary of your best ideas / solutions by dividing an A4 sheet into 3 and sketching within each panel<br/>
            - Unlike the crazy 8s, these ideas should work together to form an overall solution to the problem you are addressing <br/>
            - Make it self-explanatory. Concrete beats abstract. Use sketches to turn abstract ideas into concrete solutions that can be assessed by others. <br/>
            - Ugly is okay. <br/>
            - Words matter. <br/>
            - Give it a catchy title. <br/>

          <h1>Art museum & heat map</h1>
          <p>10 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Display all everyone's 'solution' sketches on the wall or table <br/>
            - Everyone silently inspects the drawings and at the end of 10 minutes everyone chooses 2 sketches which they think would be most effective
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h1>Speed critique</h1>
          <p>40 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - As a group, discuss the highlights of each solution. <br/>
            - Take around three minutes per sketch. Time yourselves!<br/>
            - Capture standout ideas and important objections. <br/>
            - At the end, ask the sketcher if the group missed anything. <br/>

        <section>
          <h1>Straw poll</h1>
          <p>10 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Each person silently chooses a favorite idea. <br/>
            - All at once, each person places one large dot sticker to register his or her (nonbinding) vote. <br/>
            - Divide winners from “maybe-laters.” Move the sketches with supervotes together.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>RUMBLE!!!</h1>
          <p>15 minutes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Rumble or all-in-one. <br/>
            - Decide if the winners can fit into one prototype, or if conflicting ideas require two or three competing prototypes in a Rumble. <br/>
            - Use this technique whenever you need to quickly gather ideas from the group and narrow down to a decision. <br/>
            - Ask people to write ideas individually, then list them on a whiteboard, vote, and let that decide the winner. <br/>
            - If you want, you can use this method to decide on an initial product name

        <section>
          <h1>Storyboard</h1>
          <p>2.5 hours</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            - Draw a grid. About fifteen squares on a whiteboard. <br/>
            - Choose an opening scene. Think of how customers normally encounter your product or service. Keep your opening scene simple: web search, magazine article, store shelf, etc. 
            - Fill out the storyboard. Move existing sketches to the storyboard when you can. Draw when you can’t, but don’t write together. 
            - Include just enough detail to help the team prototype on Thursday. When in doubt, take risks. The finished story should be five to fifteen steps.
            - When you're done, make sure to document your storyboard in your github repo
